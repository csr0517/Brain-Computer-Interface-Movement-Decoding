# Brain-Computer Interface Movement Decoding

This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for decoding movement intentions from EEG data, specifically distinguishing between actual and imagined movements of left or right arms. The system utilizes advanced dimensionality reduction techniques and provides decision statistics for enhanced classification reliability.
